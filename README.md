# HOMEWORK: EXPRESS REPS!!!!

Tonight, you will be practicing your Express learning so far by _retyping_ the wonderful flashcard app, YAY!!!

This will be your first full CRUD with views! So we get to see the flashcard app working!

In this repo you will find two express apps:
- `flashcards-app`: a full CRUD version of the flashcards app. ðŸ¤”
- `my-flashcards-app`: A file structure that looks a _lot like_ the flashcards app ... but it's **totally blank**!!!!!

Your task is to **retype** the entire `flashcards-app` app into `my-flashcards-app`.

It should also use the same database as what is written in the dbConfig file! Or else nothing will work.....

### BEFORE YOU START!!!

[Do these wrist exercises!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPO-zST-7EE) This is going to be _a lot of typing_.

### But whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Because it is _extremely important_ to get the muscle memory for building an express app down!
